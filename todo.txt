To do list for the algorithm [vikram]:

subtyping: zscore and atypicality
subtyping model selection 
patient staging: introduce 2D staging. uncertainties from boostrapping.
confounding factors and / or combat harmonization
missing data support in subtyping
mallows model: either switch to C or https://github.com/ekhiru/top-k-mallows
mixture model with M gaussians, 1 subtype: add weighted input support for sklearn Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model
generate random dataset for testing 1 gaussian, 1 subtype

To do for visualize functions [julia]:

event-centers, including multiple subtypes
patient staging with uncertainty
Gaussian fits with bootstrap uncertainties
Individual test subject info with uncertainties
overview visualization of subtyping 
overview of multiple subtyping
