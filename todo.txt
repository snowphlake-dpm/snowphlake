To do list for the software:

hierarchical subtyping: get p_subtypes accurately
bootstrapping
model selection with heterogeneity minimization
patient staging: introduce 2D staging. uncertainties from boostrapping.
non integer diagnosis
coinit support
confounding factors
visualize functions: Ordering, timeline, 2D patient staging, Gaussian fits with bootstrap uncertainties, Individual test subject info with uncertainties, heterogeneity minimization plot with confidence interval, heterogeneity and subtyping visualization
missing data support
generate random dataset for testing 1 gaussian, 1 subtype

To do list for the algorithm: 

mallows model: either switch to C or BayesMallow R library
mixture model with M gaussians, 1 subtype: add weighted input support for sklearn Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model
